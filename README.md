# Prototyping-in-projects

## 1.0 What is prototyping
Prototyping is a form of Development model that can be used to help a project meet certain requirements easier, it is the process of using an early version of the project to analyse the direction it is going in and use that to further progress. There are many different forms of prototyping models and each one can have advantages and disadvantages depending on the conditions of the project, this can mean the timeframe, scope or team of the project can affect what type of prototyping model can be used.

### 1.1 why use prototyping? What advantages does it have for the client and developer?

Prototyping is a very commonly used Development model and often has its issues, there is always an issue with communication with a client, as communication can take up a lot of time of the project and can cause many issues as such. However, there is a large amount of advantages to using prototyping as a Development model.

Prototyping adds a large amount of functionality towards projects, with prototyping a developer and client can see issues early on rather than having lots of issues and bugs later down the line. By having different checks on each stage of the project, both parties can perform an analysis on the current progress on the project. What this means is that if there are any issues, then developers know that it is held within this stage of the project and not the other parts of it. This makes debugging and finding solutions much easier and faster as the developer can point to a certain point of the project and check through that part instead of having to look throughout the entire project to find a discrepancy within it.

As well as allowing different forms of problem solving, prototyping also allows the client and developer to keep track on how the project is doing and if it still being created to fulfil certain requirements. When developers are creating projects, it is common that they will create more than what the client has asked for or even creating somethings that are not necessary for the function to be completed. Because of this prototyping it a great way to allow the client to keep up to date with how the project is going, this means that the final product will reflect the client’s needs a lot more than if it was all built without that communication with the client.

As well as this, prototyping is much quicker than other Development models, for example a waterfall Development model can take much longer than prototyping since it requires a lot of checks before the project can be continued and I means that some parties will have to wait for others to complete their stage before continuing, therefore it can be slower. When prototyping, checks are done regularly, and analysis can be done during checks so problems can be fixed as the rest of the analysis is done and not its own separate process that is done away from the project time frame.

### 1.2 Different tools used in prototyping.

When creating a project and using the prototyping development model, many companies will use certain tools that can help prototype more effectively and efficiently than attempting to create prototypes on their own software. Tools can be very useful towards prototyping as they can help shorten timeframes down as workload is not as high and functionality is easier to access. 

Some tools for prototyping add functionality by giving the developer a safe space to design and develop whilst also giving the option to constantly edit and adapt their prototype towards the type of requirements needed for the project. One example of a prototyping tool that is used is “wireframe”, this is a website that gives developers options to design their UI before even beginning development, it does this by offering graphic design options in forms of shapes that can be drag, dropped, rotated and colourised to benefit the user.

Another example is the software called “prottapp”, this website allows for UI design to be done within the boundaries of an IOS or android system. It provides screen mockups, website layouts, desktop software prototyping examples and allows such functionality as interactive UI prototyping in order to help a developer craft a rough image that is also functionable in order to get a good idea of what needs to be done with the UI.

As well as this there are websites like “Repl.it”, this is a website that allows access to a coding space and API set to whatever language suits the user, the website does not support images however text based code can be tested, debugged and ran through a comprehensive debugging system and syntax highlighting for whatever language the developer has chosen. This website allows many different developers to get an early version of their project without having any forms of imagery. This allows projects to be planned to make sure the software that is being designed can work and function properly in order to have a strong foundation for a project to be developed.
